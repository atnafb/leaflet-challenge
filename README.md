# Earthquake Data Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes real-time earthquake data using **Leaflet.js** and data provided by the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**. 
The interactive map displays earthquake occurrences for the last seven days, depth, and magnitude to help users better understand seismic activities.

## About USGS
